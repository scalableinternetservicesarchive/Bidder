# Bidder

## Project description:

The goal for this long term project �Bidder� is to understand the principles of the server and ruby on rail server design and implementation. 

Project �Bidder� is an online selling and bidding system. It has the following features in the future:

* Bid

The users can add the item they want to sell to others.

* Search

We want to be able to search the specific tags in our database. For example, we can show the users all the items with tag "phone".

* Follow

For example, if the due date of the item is in one hour, the system can notify the users.

* History

This function can show the users what they have searched in the past.

* Hot item  

Our website can show that what items are viewed by most of the users, and the website will show it on the top of the page.
