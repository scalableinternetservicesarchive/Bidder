# Bidder

## Project description:

The goal for this long term project “Bidder” is to understand the principles of the server and ruby on rail server design and implementation. 

Project “Bidder” is an online selling and bidding system. It has the following features in the future:

* Bid

The users can add the item they want to sell to others.

* Search

We want to be able to search the specific tags in our database. For example, we can show the users all the items with tag "phone".

* Follow

For example, if the due date of the item is in one hour, the system can notify the users.

* History

This function can show the users what they have searched in the past.

* Hot item  

Our website can show that what items are viewed by most of the users, and the website will show it on the top of the page.
